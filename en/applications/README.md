## Blockstrap Applications

Blockstrap Applications are self-contained fully-functioning packaged distributions that interact with one or more of the primary Blockstrap Components (such as our [Framework](../framework/) or [API](../api/)). They are maintained and documented in order to provide developers with an understanding of how our stack works.

___We do not recommend using them as a means of storing your life savings and doing so without actually understanding how it all works would be particularly stupid and certainly something we would not encourage or endorse.___

With that said, feel free to jump straight-in and play around with the following example applications:

* [Wallet](wallet/) - [Framework](../framework/) Theme - [[Demo](#)]
* [Explorer](explorer/) - Standalone PHP / [API](../api/) Application - [[Demo](#)]
* [Prioritizer](prioritizer/) - [Framework](../framework/) Theme - [[Demo](#)]
* [Calculator](calculator/) - [Framework](../framework/) Plugin - [[Demo](#)]
