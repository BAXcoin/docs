## Blockstrap Applications

Blockstrap Applications are self-contained fully-functioning packaged distributions that interact with one or more of the primary Blockstrap Components (such as our [Framework](../framework/) or [API](../api/)). They are maintained and documented in order to provide developers with an understanding of how our stack works.

___We do not recommend using them as a means of storing your life savings and doing so without actually understanding how it all works would be particularly stupid and certainly something we would not encourage or endorse.___ Read more about our [wallet security](wallet/security/) before proceeding.

With that said, feel free to jump straight-in and play around with the following example applications:

* [Wallet](wallet/) - Framework Theme | [Demo](http://demo.blockstrap.com/wallet/v0.4.0.1/)
* [Explorer](explorer/) - Standalone PHP / API Application | [Demo](http://blockchains.io)
* [Prioritizer](prioritizer/) - Framework Theme | [Demo](http://demo.blockstrap.com/priority/v0.1.0.1/)
