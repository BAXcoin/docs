## BlockAuth Sample Application

BlockAuth is an early open-beta preview experiementing with blockchain authentication.

BlockAuth allows users and site owners to verify an identity without the need for an email address or other data that users may wish to keep private. How much (or how little) of your identity you wish to reveal is up to you.

It is a standalone PHP application that requires an Apache Server with CURL functionality. It utilizes the BlockStrap [API](../../../api/) and [PHP SDK](../../../sdks/php/) to register and retreave credentials to and from all supported blockchains, with optional added functionality for [DNKey](http://dnkey.org) support, with a screenshot provided below:
