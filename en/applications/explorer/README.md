## Blockstrap Explorer

Without building and using our own applications, there would be no real way for us to innovate within the functionality of our own tools. Our journey with Blockstrap started with our desire to build a wallet that did not store any private keys anywhere, could transact with any crypto-currency, and be easily extended via themes and plugins. In order to do this, we needed an API that could handle multiple currencies, and do so in a consistent manner, whilst also being open for further extension through the transmission of additional arbitary meta data. We could not find a suitable solution, so we built our own. Nonetheless, an API without an explorer is also kind of pointless, so we decided to release our own, publicly available at [blockchains.io](http://blockchains.io). The source code for this can also be downloaded and run as a standalone OpenSource PHP Application to help learn how to manipulate data from our API.
