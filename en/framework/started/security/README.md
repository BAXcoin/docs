And then ...?

### Device Salts

By default, the [installation of the wallet](../../../applications/wallet/installation/) guides new users through the process of deterministically generating a device salt. Blockstrap then uses compounding encryption through a modular method from within the browser that allows each application developer to deploy systems of varying levels of security dependent on their project needs or application environment. By default, we then use the salt to generate secure deterministic private keys that are not stored anywhere but can be easily recrerated inline at the moment they are required.
