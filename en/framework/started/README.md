## Getting Started

When you [download](download/) Blockstrap and open the `index.html` file from within a browser (or visit the root directory from a server) you should be presented with a rendered user-view of the default [wallet](../../applications/wallet/) application, which is one of several themes included within core. If this is the first time you have used Blockstrap from that domain on that device, you should be asked to setup your device salt else you would in the case of the default wallet be presented with the wallet itself.

However, what you see and when you see it is very much dependent on the theme or application that is being used or presented. In the case of [prioritizer](../../applications/priortizer/) there are even admin and user views, and only adminstrators are ever asked to set things up.

### Device Salts

By default, the [installation of the wallet](../../applications/wallet/installation/) guides new users through the process of deterministaclly generating a device salt. We use compounding encryption through a modular method that allows each application developer to deploy systems of varying levels of [security](security/).
