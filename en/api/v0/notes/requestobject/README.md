## Request Object


Each sucessfull reqest made to the API returns a Request Object. It provides details about the request made to
the API, the parameters used by the Blockstrap API and other request properties. It can be used to debug requests
that are returning 'strange' results and to verify that options passed into the API are correctly interpreted.
