## Top of the chain

**This is mostly a placeholder stub. It will be expanded upon shortly**

Working near the top of the blockchain has some gotchas as Transactions progress from
 Unconfirmed to Mined.

Remember that the blockchain sometimes forks, and that Transactions that are only in the
orphaned chain will return to the general pool for mining. This means that a Transaction
that only has a few confirmations has the potential to revert to unconfirmed.

It is considered best practice to wait for at least 6 confirmations before considering a Transaction
as fully confirmed.
