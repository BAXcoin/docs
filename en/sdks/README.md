Blockstrap SDKs
==================

The following SDKs are available:

* [PHP](php/)
* [Ruby](ruby/)

Our long-term goal is to recreate the complete [HTML5 Framework](../framework/) in all SDKs, with additional functionality specifically aimed at server-side implementations. In their current state, all SDKs should at least provide the following modules:

* __api__
* __cache__

Some of them may also include these additional modules:

* __blockauth__
* __dnkey__
